Rules:
- Extract observations that capture meaningful work, decisions, findings, or changes.
- Titles must be specific, keyword-rich, and searchable.
- Narratives should explain the WHAT and the WHY in 1-3 sentences.
- When in doubt, extract rather than skip - empty results should be rare.
"""

EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the conversation snippet below and extract up to 5 structured observations.

Return a JSON array. Even modest but useful observations should be included.

--- Observation Types ---
- gotcha: A hidden trap, edge case, or counter-intuitive behavior that could bite someone later.
- decision: An architectural or design choice with reasoning.
- trade-off: A deliberate compromise between competing goals.
- problem-solution: A bug or issue and how it was fixed.
- what-changed: A concrete code/config change and its effect.
- how-it-works: An explanation of a mechanism or system behavior.
- discovery: A surprising finding or newly learned fact.
- why-it-exists: The rationale behind a feature, rule, or pattern.
- general: Fallback for any notable information that doesn't fit above.

--- Field Schema ---
- type: one of the types above
- title: a short, specific, keyword-rich title (e.g., "Hook timeout too short for npm install on slow networks")
- narrative: 1-3 concise sentences summarizing the insight
- files: array of relevant file paths (empty if none)
- concepts: array of key technical terms or domain concepts (empty if none)
- token_count: rough integer estimate of narrative length in tokens

--- What to Extract ---
- File modifications and their purpose
- Configuration changes and their rationale
- Tool usage patterns and outcomes
- Task completions and their results
- Any work that was done during the conversation
- Decisions made and why
- Problems encountered and solutions found
- API behaviors or limits discovered

--- Examples ---
Good observation: {{"type": "what-changed", "title": "Modified observation_extractor.py to improve extraction", "narrative": "Made changes to the observation extraction logic to capture more meaningful work from the conversation.", "files": ["backend/agent/observation_extractor.py"], "concepts": ["observation", "extraction"], "token_count": 35}}
Good observation: {{"type": "problem-solution", "title": "Fixed memory page not showing data after compression", "narrative": "The memory page was not displaying extracted observations after context compression. Root cause was the LLM returning empty results due to overly strict extraction criteria.", "files": [], "concepts": ["memory", "compression", "LLM"], "token_count": 45}}
